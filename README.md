I wrote an essay investigating the Relationship between the Price-Earnings Ratio, Price-To-Book Ratio, Dividend Yield, Earnings per share, Payout ratio and Stock Price of Nifty 500 Index â€“ Evidence from Indian Stock Market

The aim is to assess the correlation between NIFTY 500 Index Price and 5 ratios under NIFTY 500: Price-Earnings ratio (P/E), Price-to-book ratio (PB), Dividend Yield (DY), Earnings per share, and Payout ratio, which applied to analyze the foreseeability of the NIFTY Index price in India equity market to measure whether these ratios could provide insights into the future direction of equity prices or not. In investors perspectives, they could use these rations to generate optimized and reasonable investment portfolios and strategies
